# QAOA hybrid algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman's problem

The Travelling Salesman's problem is a NP-hard problem, commonly solved using bruteforce. The problem is that a Salesman travels from city to city selling products. How can the salesman/slaesperson travel from city to city in the most efficient way, to maximise the amount of time the salesperson can sell products for?

This was developed by W.R Hamilton in the 19th century.
